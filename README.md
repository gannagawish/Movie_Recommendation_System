# 🎬 Movie Recommendation System

A simple Java-based Movie Recommendation System that suggests movies based on user preferences. This project demonstrates basic concepts of recommendation algorithms, data handling, and object-oriented programming in Java.

---

## 📌 Features

- Recommends movies based on:
  - User ratings
  - Genre preferences
  - Similar users (collaborative filtering)
- Simple and clean Java structure
- Easy to extend and modify

## 🔍 Recommendation Logic

- **Content-Based Filtering**: Recommends similar movies based on genre and description.
- **Collaborative Filtering** (optional): Recommends movies based on user similarity.
- **Hybrid Approach** (if you combined both).
